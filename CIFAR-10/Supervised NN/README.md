This is the 1st out of three exercises for the class "Neural Networks - Deep Learning".<br>
Different neural networks are deployed (combination of MLP and CNN) in order to classify the CIFAR-10 images.<br>
Feature Engineering: CIFAR-10 images are converted to grayscale images and bispectrum stats are calculated.<br>
For bisectrum calculation, HOSA MATLAB TOOLBOX is necessary (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3013-hosa-higher-order-spectral-analysis-toolbox).<br>
